# RentCar

The application uses an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for: managing and renting a car, information about its status and specifications, but also the calculation of the price.
The application uses an authentication portal, which depending on the data
introduced is divided into two areas:
   -administrator: can add or delete cars from the database data and manage appointments and related check-out.
   -customer: any person can create an account with which they can view and rent one or more available cars or can view the booking history.
